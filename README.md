<h2>
Description
</h2>

<p>The purpose of this project was to create a web application where the user can create <br>
a profile by signing up and then go on to view other user reviews and create reviews of their own.<br>
When the user loads the application they will see a landing page asking them to either login or signup<br>
Once signed in, the user will see that the navigation bar changes to provide them with new options as seen below.<br>

Find the deployed app at: https://fit-check1.herokuapp.com/

<h2>
Challanges
</h2>

<p>There were a lot of things that I found very difficult including linking the front to back end as well as managing forms.<br>
As a result much of the customer facing forms are not yet functional and will have to be corrected in future development.
